         <p class="p List2">6.3.3 Designated trainers who have not conducted source selection training within a two (2) year period must be recertified. Recertification requires that the SCO confirm the individual’s continued designation as a source selection trainer and that the individual re-complete the “Train-the-Trainer” training.</p>

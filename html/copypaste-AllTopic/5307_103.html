         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(d) The tailorable Contract Type Determination and Findings template at <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/daffars/part-5316-types-contracts#DAFFARS_5316_103" target="_blank">5316.103(d)</a> may be used to document contract type selections for acquisitions not requiring a written acquisition plan. </p>
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(e) Prepare written acquisition plans in accordance with <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-7#FAR_7_103" target="_blank">FAR 7.103</a> and the dollar thresholds identified at <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-207-acquisition-planning#DFARS_207.103" target="_blank">DFARS 207.103(d)(i)</a>. Notwithstanding the requirements <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-207-acquisition-planning#DFARS_207.103" target="_blank">DFARS 207.103(e)</a>, acquisition plans may be written on a program basis when the requiring activity chooses to write a single plan for all known program actions or on an individual contract basis when there is only one contract, task or delivery order to be covered by the plan. An acquisition plan is not required for individual orders when the contract-level acquisition plan adequately covers all anticipated orders and the order is issued IAW the terms of the basic contract.</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(h) Contracting officers shall maintain decision support information in the contract file for acquisitions that do not require written acquisition plans as well as those that do. Where a written plan is not required, contract documentation such as memoranda for record, market research reports (i.e., <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/AQCP/KnowledgeCenter/SitePages/DAFFARS-Templates.aspx" target="_blank">Streamlined Market Acquisition Approach Document (SMRAA)</a>), and <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/AQCP/KnowledgeCenter/SitePages/DAFFARS-Templates.aspx" target="_blank">Streamlined Acquisition Strategy Summary (SASS)</a> may be used to record acquisition pre-award decisions and risk assessment information. The acquisition team shall ensure consistency among requirements, acquisition planning, market research, and solicitation documents and, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication of information between documents (e.g., by referencing content).</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(i) Unless otherwise designated by the acquisition approving authority, the planner for acquisitions is the program manager, or other official responsible for the program (i.e., requiring activity). </p>
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(j) The Senior Contracting Official (SCO) holds acquisition approving authority unless otherwise designated in <a class="xref" href="https://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/saf_aq/publication/afi63-101_20-101/afi63-101_20-101.pdf" target="_blank">DAFI 63-101/20-101 </a>, Integrated Life Cycle Management and <a class="xref" href="https://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/saf_aq/publication/dafi63-138/dafi63-138.pdf" target="_blank">DAFI 63-138</a>, Acquisition of Services. Unless otherwise prohibited by regulation or policy, the acquisition approving authority may delegate acquisition plan approval to one level above the contracting officer for other than firm-fixed-price contracts and the contracting officer for firm-fixed-price contracts. </p>
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(l) An <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/AQCP/KnowledgeCenter/SitePages/DAFFARS-Templates.aspx" target="_blank">Acquisition Plan</a> template is available for preparing written acquisition plans. </p>
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(m) Only the acquisition approving authority may waive requirements of detail and formality.</p>

apply to prevent conflicting roles which may bias the Contractor's
judgment or objectivity, or to preclude the Contractor from
obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future

        <p class="p List2">
"Contractor" means the business entity receiving the award of this
contract, its parents, affiliates, divisions and
subsidiaries.</p>
        <p class="p List2">
"Development" means all efforts towards solution of broadly-defined
problems. This may encompass research, evaluating technical
feasibility, proof of design and test, or engineering of programs
not yet approved for acquisition or operation.</p>
        <p class="p List2">
"Proprietary Information" means all information designated as
proprietary in accordance with law and regulation, and held in
confidence or disclosed under restriction to prevent uncontrolled
distribution. Examples include limited or restricted data, trade
secrets, sensitive financial information, and computer software;
and may appear in cost and pricing data or involve classified
information.</p>
        <p class="p List2">
"System" means the system that is the subject of this
contract.</p>
        <p class="p List2">
"System Life" means all phases of the system's development,
production, or support.</p>
        <p class="p List2">

        <p class="p List2">(2) Restrictions: The Contractor shall perform

overall contractual responsibility for the system's development,
integration, assembly and checkout, or production. The parties
recognize that the Contractor shall occupy a highly influential and
responsible position in determining the system's basic concepts and
supervising their execution by other Contractors. The Contractor's
judgment and recommendations must be objective, impartial, and
independent. To avoid the prospect of the Contractor's judgment or
recommendations being influenced by its own products or
capabilities, it is agreed that the Contractor is precluded for the
life of the system from award of a DoD contract to supply the
system or any of its major components, and from acting as a
subcontractor or consultant to a DoD supplier for the system or any
of its major components.</p>

        <p class="p List2">(1) For actions that do not fall within one of the
categories listed within <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-207-acquisition-planning#DFARS_207.103" target="_blank">DFARS
207.103</a> or actions with dollar thresholds less than a need for
a written <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/AQCP/KnowledgeCenter/SitePages/DAFFARS-Templates.aspx" target="_blank">Acquisition
Plan</a> (e.g. &lt;$50M total program or &lt;$25M in a FY for
products &amp; services), written AP documentation is still
recommended. This documentation may include Market Research
Acquisition Approach document (MRAA), Briefing Charts, Memorandum
for Record, or use of the Streamlined Acquisition Strategy Summary
as directed by the applicable approval authority.</p>
        <p class="p List2">(2) Actions above $10M but below the thresholds
prescribed at DFARS 207.103, written AP documentation is
recommended. Acquisition Teams should consider the depth,
complexity, and requirements needs of their program to determine
use of the <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/AQCP/KnowledgeCenter/SitePages/DAFFARS-Templates.aspx" target="_blank">AP
template</a>, ASP brief, or the <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/AQCP/KnowledgeCenter/SitePages/DAFFARS-Templates.aspx" target="_blank">Streamlined
Market Acquisition Approach Document (SMRAA)</a> template.</p>
        <p class="p List2">(3) Actions for production or services when the
total cost of all contracts for the acquisition program is equal to
or greater than $50M for all years or $25M or more for any fiscal
year, an Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP) is recommended. (Note:
recommend documentation that identifies the ASP as the written
AP)</p>
        <p class="p List2">(4) The acquisition strategy approval authority
may utilize the ASP briefing charts and associated note pages,
minutes, and change charts to satisfy a required written AP.
Recommend documentation identifies the ASP as the written AP.</p>

            Sessions.</p>
         <p class="p">Source selection training must be presented to the entire SST,
            including the SSA, SSAC Chair and members, PM (where one is
            assigned), RO,and all advisors. Independent review of source
            selection training materials by SST members and/or attendance at
            “Train-the-Trainer” training is not sufficient to satisfy this
            training requirement.</p>

         <p class="p List1">6.4.2 Training Content and Process.</p>
         <p class="p List1">The SAF/AQCP Knowledge Management Team develops and maintains source selection training modules to assist Source Selection Trainers. Trainers are encouraged to tailor the modules, as needed, to meet the unique elements of the instant acquisition.</p>
         <p class="p List1">The <strong class="ph b">Ethics, Procurement Integrity, and Conflicts of Interest</strong> topic should be presented by the local legal advisor. Links to Ethics training material are included in both Phase I and Phase II source selection training materials. The use of locally-developed Ethics training by local legal advisors is encouraged. The length of the source selection training and the level of detail presented in either Phase I (Acquisition Planning) or Phase II (Source Selection Execution) depends on the complexity of the specific acquisition and the experience level of the SST.</p>
         <p class="p List1">6.4.3 Advance Preparation.</p>
         <p class="p List1">Effectiveness of the source selection training experience can be enhanced with advance preparation.

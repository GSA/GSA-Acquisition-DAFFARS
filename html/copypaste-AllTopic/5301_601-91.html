         <p class="p List1">(a) The DAF Self-Inspection program assesses compliance with federal laws, regulatory policies, DoD and <span class="ph Revised June 12, 2024">D</span>AF directives, and instructions across the enterprise. It is also used to verify adequacy of contract preparation.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) SCOs will manage a self-inspection program, which includes both the assessment of individual contract files and the assessment of contracting management programs contained in the <span class="ph Revised June 12, 2024">Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) Self-Assessment Checklists (SACs)</span> as required by <a class="xref" href="https://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/saf_ig/publication/dafi90-302/dafi90-302.pdf" target="_blank">DAFI 90-302</a>, The Inspection System of the Department of the Air Force<span class="ph Revised June 12, 2024">, and the assessment of individual contract files</span>. As a minimum, contracting offices must perform <span class="ph Revised June 12, 2024">post-award</span> self-inspections of individual contract files on an annual basis.<span class="ph Revised June 12, 2024"> The results of the assessment of contracting management programs contained in the SACs are reported in MICT by individual units. The results of self-inspection of individual contract files are not reported in MICT.</span>
         </p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) For self-inspection of individual<span class="ph Revised June 12, 2024"> FAR-based </span>contract files reviewed after award<span class="ph Revised June 12, 2024">, to include Special Access Programs (SAP)/classified contract files, </span>SCOs <span class="ph Revised June 12, 2024">shall</span> use the <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/AQCP/KnowledgeCenter/SitePages/DAFFARS-Templates.aspx" target="_blank">Air Force Contracting Self-Inspection Checklist</a>.<span class="ph Revised June 12, 2024">For Contracting offices listed in KT FileShare (KTFS), the self-inspections shall be performed utilizing the KTFS Inspection tool beginning no later than 1 October 2024 in order to capture self-inspection results. For contracting offices not listed in KTFS, the self-inspection summary data shall be submitted into the AFMC/PKQ Automated Self-Inspection Reporting Tool (ASIRT). For SAP/classified contracts reviewed, releasable results shall be reported to SAF/AQCS via secure means for briefing to SAF/AQC</span>.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) SCOs will ensure corrective actions are implemented as a result of any self-inspection<span class="ph Revised June 12, 2024"> findings</span>. Contracting offices must have a documented program for self-inspection, to include a process for closing resolved findings in a timely manner, ensuring an effective level of review necessary to close a finding, and integrating findings and resolutions into unit training.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) SCOs must <span class="ph Revised June 12, 2024">review 8% (5% for FY24 only) of their contract actions each fiscal year. </span>
            <span class="ph Revised June 12, 2024">Business/contract clearances shall not be counted towards meeting the required 8% of contracting actions reviewed. Maintaining a robust self-inspection program and sharing the data results will support a DAF-wide consolidated trend analysis report for the previous fiscal year. All reviews in KTFS, summary reporting in ASIRT, and SAP/classified reporting for the previous fiscal year must be completed by 15 February of each year.</span>

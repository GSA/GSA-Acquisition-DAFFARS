         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024">(a) When it comes to safeguarding public data, trust is paramount. Contract management security and data privacy are critical. Contracting data produced or maintained by the Contracting workforce must also be handled in accordance with applicable laws and regulations to safeguard this data. Any individuals requiring access to contract data as a result of participating on a source selection or in the performance of their duties must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement. </p>
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List3">i. Contracting Officers must ensure appropriate clauses and data protections are included in any contract, order or agreement providing the assistance of support personnel. Since contract data may include sensitive or proprietary information, it is important to protect restricted data sets from improper use. Contractors whose employees have been determined to have a “Need to know” by the data requesting organization shall have Non-disclosure Agreements (NDAs), Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) mitigation plans, necessary information owner permissions and any applicable contract clauses or articles prior to gaining access to any contracting system restricted data sets. Confirmation of these items is the responsibility of the organizations requesting access to the data and organizations are required to provide the items upon request. </p>

        <p class="p List1">(a) Contracting officers should consider ways to
engage potential offerors early and respond to industry queries,
pursuant to the contracting officer’s responsibilities under
FAR 9.504, to determine whether former federal employees should be
excluded from proposal preparation. When Contracting officers
become aware that a former federal employee is involved in a
contractor’s proposal preparation, the CO shall determine
whether that employee should be excluded from the proposal
preparation effort. The CO shall document the supporting rationale
within the determination as to whether the former federal employee
should be excluded from the proposal preparation efforts or not. In
addition to the ethics advisory opinions under <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-3#FAR_3_104_6" target="_blank">FAR
3.104-6</a>, should a former federal employee participate in
preparing a competitive proposal on behalf of an employer or
client, and it relates to the prior employment as a federal
employee, the individual should inform his/her employer/client of
this fact and have that entity communicate such facts to the
Contracting Officer in accordance with <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-3#FAR_3_104" target="_blank">FAR
3.104</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-9#FAR_9_505" target="_blank">FAR
9.505</a>. One of the guiding principles established by the
decisions of the courts is the obligation of contracting agencies
to avoid even the appearance of impropriety in government
procurements. See <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-3#FAR_3_101_1" target="_blank">FAR
3.101-1</a>. In this regard, where a firm may have gained an unfair
competitive advantage through its hiring of a former government
official, the contracting officer may disqualify a firm from a
competition based on the appearance of impropriety tied to an
organizational conflict of interest which is created by this
situation, that is, even if no actual impropriety can be shown.</p>

In cases where the SCO is the individual disqualified from
participation in a procurement, the cognizant HCA must authorize

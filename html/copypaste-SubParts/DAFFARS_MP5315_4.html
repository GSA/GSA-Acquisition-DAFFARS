            </p>
            <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(a) In response to this Request for Proposals (RFP), the offeror shall prepare and submit certified cost or pricing data and supporting attachments in accordance with Table 15-2 of <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-15#FAR_15_408" target="_blank">FAR 15.408</a>. Further, the offeror shall (1) utilize the DFARS provision <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/252.215-7009-proposal-adequacy-checklist." target="_blank">252.215-7009</a>, <em class="ph i">Proposal Adequacy Checklist (PAC)</em>, in pre-submission proposal quality reviews, and (2) furnish the completed checklist as part of their proposal submission.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(1) The responsibility for providing a well-prepared and fully supported cost proposal lies solely with the offeror. The basis and rationale for all proposed costs shall be provided as part of the proposal so that the contracting officer has the information necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed price.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(2) If the offeror is unsure as to whether a checklist item is required in support of the proposal, or how to adequately comply with a checklist item, the offeror shall contact the contracting officer as soon as possible after receipt of the RFP, but in any case prior to proposal submittal, to resolve the questions. </p>
            <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List2">(3) Non-compliances with the DFARS Proposal Adequacy Checklist and the additional requirements of this provision will require immediate correction; however, completion of the checklist does not relieve the offeror from the responsibility to comply with all applicable regulations and any special requirements of the solicitation.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(4) The offeror is encouraged to flow down this provision to subcontractors/affiliates required to submit certified cost or pricing data in support of this RFP. </p>
            <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(b) The offeror is advised that the contracting officer may find costs associated with revision/rework of inadequate cost proposals unreasonable and will consider the nature and extent of any proposal inadequacies when assessing/negotiating profit.</p>
            <p class="p List1">(c) In order to preclude delays in negotiations and contract award, the completed PAC submitted with the proposal shall provide a clear explanation for any checklist items not included in the proposal, particularly items not provided based on any of the exceptions to certified cost or pricing data found at <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-15#FAR_15_403_1" target="_blank">FAR 15.403-1(b)</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-212-acquisition-commercial-products-and-commercial-services#DFARS_212.102" target="_blank">DFARS 212.102(a)(i)(B)</a>. </p>
            <p class="p List1">(d) Cost Proposal Requirements. In addition to the requirements identified in the DFARS PAC, the following also apply to the cost proposal submitted in response to this RFP. </p>
            <p class="p List2">(1) Breakout by Year. If the proposal includes more than one CLIN, the proposal shall include a breakout of CLIN prices by cost element by Contractor Fiscal Year (CFY). At the contracting officer’s direction, the breakout by year shall also be provided by: <em class="ph i">(select applicable breakouts)</em> 
            </p>
            <p class="p">Government Fiscal Year (GFY)</p>
            <p class="p">Calendar Year (CY)</p>
            <p class="p">The proposal shall define the timeframe of the Contractor Fiscal Year (for example, January – December).</p>
            <p class="p List2">(2) If the proposal includes more than one CLIN/subCLIN, recurring/non-recurring costs shall be identified for each CLIN/subCLIN. </p>
            <p class="p List2">(3) When the proposal includes material costs, the proposal shall include a consolidated bill of materials (CBOM) at the total contract level in an electronic, sortable format (Excel spreadsheet or other format approved by the contracting officer). </p>
            <p class="p List3">i. When the amounts proposed in the CBOM include application of escalation, the proposal shall identify the base value, the escalation rate(s) used, and the escalation amount associated with each item escalated. </p>
            <p class="p List3">ii. When the proposed amount is based on historical data which has been adjusted (for example, for differences in quantity), the CBOM shall clearly identify the adjustments made to the historical data and the reason for each adjustment. </p>
            <p class="p List2">(4) All costs proposed on the basis of Cost Estimating Relationships (CER) shall be fully supported. The proposal shall identify the basis for the proposed rate, shall identify the base to which the rate is applied, and shall clearly demonstrate the calculation of proposed costs based on CERs. </p>
            <p class="p List2">(5) For any costs incurred prior to proposal submission, the proposal shall identify actual hours and cost incurred as well as hours/costs to complete and the time phasing associated with these hours/costs. This information/data shall be provided in a time-phased cost element summary format.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(6) Submission of Historical Actual Costs Incurred. <em class="ph i">(Insert in RFPs for follow-on efforts as applicable. The contracting officer may identify specific contracts for which submission of actual cost data is required (for example, the last three lot buys of the same item), or may require that the contractor identify its most recent sales of the items to any customers, if the contractor’s sales base is broader than the current buying office. Language may be tailored to request insight into specific areas of cost (e.g., sustaining engineering hours). However, the contracting officer should take into consideration the extent to which the contractor’s existing business systems can support requests for granularity in reporting of actual costs incurred, as well as the potential time and cost involved in obtaining very detailed or low-level historical actuals.) </em> 
            </p>
            <p class="p List1">(i) The contractor shall provide the following information for these prior acquisitions: <em class="ph i">[contracting officer identifies the specific acquisitions for which actual cost data is required. Alternately, the contracting officer may require the contractor to identify prior and current contracts for the same items covered in this RFP.]</em> For these contracts, the contractor shall provide the following information: </p>
            <p class="p List1">a. contract number (including modification number if applicable) or other identifier; </p>
            <p class="p List1">b. contract type;</p>
            <p class="p List1">c. contract quantity;</p>
            <p class="p List1">d. contract price; and </p>
            <p class="p List1">e. actual cost incurred, including a breakout of actuals as recurring/non-recurring costs. If performance is not complete on any of the specified contract actions, provide an estimate to complete and the basis for that estimate. </p>
            <p class="p List1">(ii) The contractor shall also request that its top five major sole source subcontractors provide the information listed in the above paragraphs (i) a. through e. on prior contracts for items the prime is purchasing from the subcontractors for this effort. If a subcontractor’s information on prior actuals is not included in the prime’s proposal, the proposal should identify status and anticipated receipt date(s). If the subcontractor deems the information proprietary, the subcontractor may submit the information directly to the contracting officer. </p>
            <p class="p List2">(7) The proposal shall identify those actions where assist audits have been requested by the prime or sub-tier contractors and identify the request date and scheduled receipt date for those audits. The need for assist audits resulting from proprietary data rights assertions at any tier shall be identified to the contracting officer as soon as the offeror becomes aware of the need. Government performance of assist audits does not relieve the offeror of the responsibility to accomplish and provide its price/cost analysis of the subcontracts. </p>
            <p class="p List2">(8) If the offeror intends to request Performance-Based Payments (PBP), the offeror’s proposal shall include a monthly expenditure profile, proposed events and their projected completion dates, rationale on why the proposed event demonstrates significant progress towards the completion of the end item, proposed values for each event, completion criteria for each event, and an identification of each event as severable or cumulative. </p>
            <p class="p List2">(9) Commercial product and commercial service considerations: </p>
            <p class="p List3">i. The offeror’s proposal shall provide support for any subcontractor commercial product or commercial service determinations, addressing, at a minimum, the following:</p>
            <p class="p List1">a. A description of the supplies or services;</p>
            <p class="p List1">b. Specific identification of the type of commercial product or commercial service claim (<a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-2#FAR_2_101" target="_blank">FAR 2.101</a> commercial product sub-definitions (1) through (6) or commercial service sub-definitions (1) through (3)), and the basis on which the product or service meets the definition; and</p>
            <p class="p List1">c. For modified commercial products (commercial product sub-definition (3)), classification of the modification(s) with supporting rationale as either:</p>
            <p class="p List2">1. Of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace (<a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-2#FAR_2_101" target="_blank">FAR 2.101</a> commercial product sub-definition (3)(i)); or </p>
            <p class="p List2">2. A minor modification of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Government requirements (<a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-2#FAR_2_101" target="_blank">FAR 2.101</a> commercial product sub-definition (3)(ii)). </p>
            <p class="p">Note that per <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-15#FAR_15_403_1" target="_blank">FAR 15.403-1(c)(3)(iii)(B)</a>, modifications that meet the definition of minor modifications of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace as defined in <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-2#FAR_2_101" target="_blank">FAR 2.101</a>, paragraph (3)(ii) of the commercial product definition, will require the submission of certified cost and pricing data when the total price of all such modifications exceeds the greater of the threshold for certified cost or pricing data (<a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-15#FAR_15_403_4" target="_blank">FAR 15.403-4</a>) or 5% of the total price of the contract at the time of contract award. </p>
            <p class="p List3">ii. For proposed subcontract commercial products or commercial services “of a type”, or “evolved” or modified (<a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-2#FAR_2_101" target="_blank">FAR 2.101</a> commercial product sub-definitions (1) through (3) or commercial service sub-definition (2)), the offeror shall provide a technical description of the differences between the proposed product or service and the comparison product or service and thoroughly address the cost differences between the proposed product or service and the comparison product or service. </p>
            <p class="p List3">iii. The proposal shall include, or the offeror shall make available, data other than certified cost or pricing data to establish price reasonableness of the proposed subcontract commercial product or commercial service (to include any modifications not subject to the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data) by supplying:</p>
            <p class="p List1">a. Information/data related to competition, if competition is the offeror’s basis for asserting the reasonableness of the proposed subcontract price. </p>
            <p class="p List1">b. Information/data related to prices (sales data, market price assessments, etc.). Note that subcontractors may submit sales data directly to the contracting officer if the subcontractor deems the data proprietary. </p>
            <p class="p List1">c. The prime contractor’s or higher tier subcontractor’s price analysis/price reasonableness determination for the commercial subcontract in accordance with <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-15#FAR_15_404_3" target="_blank">FAR 15.404-3(b)(1)</a> and (2). </p>
            <p class="p List1">d. Cost information/data (cost element breakdown and supporting documentation not subject to certification in accordance with <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-15#FAR_15_406_2" target="_blank">FAR 15.406-2</a>). Instances where cost information may be required include but are not limited to commercial products offered but never actually sold to the public, “of a type” commercial products or commercial services, or when sales data is limited and/or not recent and/or not for the same/similar quantities. </p>
            <p class="p">Note that the preferred method of establishing the price reasonableness of commercial products and commercial services is to obtain commercial sales data. It is recognized that other methods, such as market price assessment data or evaluation of cost data not subject to certification, are also acceptable when prior sales data cannot be obtained. Sales data shall (1) demonstrate sales to the general public; (2) be current; and (3) where possible, be in like quantities. Products sold to state, local, or foreign governments or products sold with applications only to state, local, or foreign government or US Government end items are not considered to be sales to the general public unless the proposed commercial product meets the <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-2#FAR_2_101" target="_blank">FAR 2.101</a> commercial product definition sub-definition (6). </p>

         <p class="p List1">a. A contracting officer request for supporting data/documentation from a contractor (whether verbally or in writing) after proposal receipt, must clearly state what data/documentation is needed and when it should be provided. </p>
         <p class="p List1">b. If requested data/documentation is not readily available because of extenuating circumstances (e.g., data that did not form the basis of the contractor's proposal), the contracting officer and the contractor should agree in writing as to a reasonable time for submittal of data. </p>
         <p class="p List1">c. Where system generated data is to be provided, the contracting officer should review the data fields to be reported before the data is generated to ensure a common understanding of what is needed. Inform the contractor that all data requests will be tracked and will be considered open action items until the Government concurs that the data has been received and is complete.</p>
         <p class="p List1">d. If the data is not provided by the requested date or, if applicable, the agreed-to-date, and an acceptable resolution cannot be achieved, the contracting officer must elevate the issue to appropriate senior contracting management for both the Government and the contractor until an appropriate resolution is reached. The contracting officer must document the outcome of the elevation process in writing to include any revised dates for receipt of requested data/documentation. See the <a class="xref" href="https://www.dau.mil/tools/t/DoD-Sole-Source-Streamlining-Toolbox" target="_blank">DoD Sole Source Streamlining Tool Box</a> for the recommended elevation process, as well as other streamlining techniques.</p>
         <p class="p List1">e. If, after elevation, an acceptable resolution has not occurred or the contractor fails to provide the data/documentation within the revised agreed-to date, the contracting officer may take remedial actions: </p>

         <p class="p List1">The publications above establish policy and responsibilities, reporting requirements, and follow-up procedures for contract audit reports issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Inspector General of the Department of Defense (IG DoD), Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), and the other internal audit agencies (such as the Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA)).</p>
         <p class="p List1">2. SAF/AQCP manages the Department of the Air Force (DAF) CAFU program</p>
         <p class="p List1">3.CAFU requirements for DCAA audit reports:</p>
         <p class="p List2">a. <strong class="ph b">SCO RESPONSIBILITIES</strong>: SCOs: </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Designate a CAFU focal point to manage the organization’s CAFU program in accordance with these procedures. The CAFU Focal Point:</p>
         <p class="p List4">(a) Monitors and ensures proper and timely resolution and disposition of contract audit reports within the focal point’s organization.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(b) Maintains current records on all reportable audits, from receipt through disposition. For open reports, this includes written milestone plans comprised, as a minimum, of target resolution and disposition dates.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(c) Ensures that acquisition personnel within their organization are properly trained in the use of contract audit reports and the requirements of the CAFU program.</p><p class="p List4">(d) Ensures that the organization’s semi-annual CAFU status report is prepared in accordance with these procedures using the web-based <a class="xref" href="https://piee.eb.mil/" target="_blank">AT-AT tool</a> on PIEE and User’s manual located on the <a class="xref" href="http://www.dcma.mil/" target="_blank">Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)</a> website. When the security classification of a contract or an audit precludes the use of the DCMA website, SCOs must seek approval from SAF/AQCP to use alternate means of reporting.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(e) Directs periodic evaluations of the organization’s CAFU program to determine whether they are adequate and result in timely, appropriate resolution and disposition of audit reports.</p>
         <p class="p List2">b. <strong class="ph b">CONTRACTING OFFICER (CO) RESPONSIBILITIES</strong>: The CO is responsible for reaching agreement with the contractor and has wide latitude and discretion in that regard. Accordingly, the procedure contained herein is structured in consonance with the independent, decision-making role of the CO and the financial advisory role of the contract auditor. COs should give full consideration to contract audit advice and must pursue timely and proper resolution and disposition of contract audit reports. Resolution of contract audit reports, other than pre-award reports, is required by OMB Circular A-50 to be accomplished within six months of report issuance. Disposition should take place as soon as possible after resolution. Per <a class="xref" href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/764002p.pdf" target="_blank">DoDI 7640.02</a>, Enclosure 3, Section 3.a, reportable audits should normally be disposed of within 12 months after issuance. The CO must document the disposition of all reported findings and recommendations in a signed and dated memorandum in accordance with <a class="xref" href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/764002p.pdf" target="_blank">DoDI 7640.02</a>, Enclosure 3, Section 3.b.</p>
         <p class="p List2">c. <strong class="ph b"> TRACKING OF AUDIT REPORTS</strong>: Contracting activities must track all contract audit reports. Tracking of non-reportable audits may be accomplished using records maintained in the contract file or in the CAFU on-line system. The designated focal point at each DAF contracting activity maintains contract audit follow-up information on a current basis. The audit tracking information will normally be managed centrally at MAJCOM/FLDCOM/DRU headquarters (except for HQ AFMC, where this tracking will occur at the field activity). For auditor-determined final, indirect cost rate reports, a report is considered received for follow-up tracking purposes when it is forwarded by the auditor to the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) for resolution and disposition.</p>
         <p class="p List2">d. <strong class="ph b"> REPORTING OF AUDIT REPORTS</strong>: Reportable audits are identified in the Glossary of <a class="xref" href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/764002p.pdf" target="_blank">DoDI 7640.02</a>. The information to be reported on each audit is identified in Enclosure 4 of the same regulation. MAJCOM/FLDCOM/DRU semi-annual status reports will be automatically transmitted using the on-line CAFU system. The reports must cover the semi-annual periods ending 31 Mar and 30 Sep and must be completed in the on-line CAFU system no later than the end of the reporting period. If there are no audits, a negative report must be prepared and submitted to the SAF/AQC Workflow with a copy to the <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/daffars/part-5302-definitions-words-and-terms" target="_blank">cognizant HCA Workflow</a>. All activities must make every possible effort to ensure the completeness and accuracy of their semi-annual reporting submission. Special attention should be focused on ensuring the most accurate data is submitted on any audit listed as unresolved and over 6 months old. </p>

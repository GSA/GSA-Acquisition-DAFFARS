            documents (see Section 4). Consider identifying a Source Selection Records Custodian (SSRC) familiar with the contracting process to
            manage all source selection documents (PCO or someone under PCO oversight). Ensure source selection material is not removed, circulated,
            or disseminated outside of the source selection work area without PCO review and approval. Ensure all means of electronic communications
            receive additional scrutiny to preclude inadvertent release of documents that contain sensitive or embedded source selection files. It is
            a good practice that prior to transmission of Source Selection Information to offerors via any means, the information is reviewed by a
            second person to preclude inadvertent inclusion of inappropriate data. Additionally, Source Selection Information transmitted to offerors
            electronically (e.g., via email or disc) or posted to a website must be distributed in a “locked” format, such as scanned .pdf file, .jpeg
            file, or other protected format, unless offerors are required to fill-in or complete portions of a document, such as Section K
            Representations and Certifications, or a pricing matrix. Using e-mail to transmit source selection information should be done judiciously
            and it must be encrypted and digitally signed. Include in the subject line the phrase “Source Selection Information – See <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-2#FAR_2_101" target="_blank">FAR 2.101</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-3#FAR_3_104" target="_blank">3.104</a>”.

            official record that must not be altered. Updates, revisions, or changes to that evaluation information must be captured in subsequent

            Excellence (ACE) (if used) regarding the management and/or retention determination of any paper or digital document generated during the
            source selection. Legal counsel, the SSEB Chair, SSRC (if other than the PCO) and the PCO must review any notes, working papers, and other
            documents for a retention determination at regular intervals during the source selection process and upon completion. </p>

Warrants limited by a monetary threshold are transferable across the DAF. A Limited Warranted CO shall not sign contract documents above the dollarized warrant limitation. Dollarized warrant limitations apply to all contract documentation and to the value of the instant contract action a CO isexecuting. For example, if a CO holds a limited warrant of $5M and the contract award amount of the instant action is $6M, the CO is not authorized to sign the contract action. </p><p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List2">(1) For zero-dollar and SAT limited warrants, contracting personnel (including purchasing agents in theGS-1105 series) must have at least one year of contracting experience. </p><p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List2">(2) For $5M limited warrants, contracting personnel must have a minimum of two years of contracting experience, <a class="xref" href="https://icatalog.dau.edu/onlinecatalog/CareerCertGuides.aspx?lvl=4&amp;cfld=3" target="_blank">DoD Contracting Professional Certification</a> (i.e., successful completion of the Contracting Certification Exam at DAU) or legacy DAWIA Contracting certification (Level I, II, or III), and have successfully completed the COT.

Warrant boards shall not be convened for warrants within this threshold. </p><p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(k) <u class="ph u">Local National (LN) Warrants</u>. LNs in an equivalent occupational series to GS-1102 may be selected for a contracting officer appointment in accordance with this MP. LN candidates for zero-dollar and SAT limited warrants must meet the same requirements for zero dollar and SAT warrants described in para (j)(1). LN candidates for $5M and $25M limited warrants must have successfully completed the COT, possess a baccalaureate degree and a minimum of two years of contracting experience, and shall complete all contracting courses required for <a class="xref" href="https://icatalog.dau.edu/onlinecatalog/CareerCertGuides.aspx?lvl=4&amp;cfld=3" target="_blank">DoD Contracting Professional Certification</a> (LNs do not have access to the system for the certification portion) or shall possess legacy DAWIA Contracting certification (Level I, II, or III). LN Unlimited Warrant candidates must meet all of the requirements described in this paragraph for $5M and $25M limited LN Warrants and must also pass a warrant board.

Since all active duty enlisted members of the DAF Contracting AFSCs 6C0X1 and 6C000 who are serving in an Air Force acquisition coded position are members of the Contingency Contracting Force, regardless of the place of duty performance or the position held, there is no need to issue a separate Contingency Contracting Officer warrant. Military and Civilian personnel with an active DAF warrant may use their existing warrant in support of both non-contingency and Contingency Operations. </p><p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(m) <u class="ph u">Non-Transferable Warrants</u>.

Candidates for limited non-transferable warrants valued at $5M must meet the same requirements for the warrant type and dollar value described in paragraph (j)(2); however, in the case of a non-transferable $5M warrant limited strictly to incremental funding-only and/or admin-only actions, passage of the COT is recommended but not required. Candidates for limited non-transferable warrants valued at $25M must meet the same requirements for the warrant type and dollar value described in paragraph (j)(3). The SF1402 must clearly state “Limited Non-Transferable Warrant” and cite the specific warrant limitations. </p><p class="p List1">(n) <u class="ph u">Warrant Transfer and Reinstatement</u>. </p><p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List2">(1) Warrants issued in accordance with this MP, except for those issued in accordance with paragraphs (l) and (m) above, are transferable across the DAF. As long as a warrant is in good standing, an individual shall not be required to test or board again. However, warrant transferability does not guarantee immediate utilization, as the gaining appointing official (see paragraph (g)(1)) may determine that time is needed to facilitate familiarity with new workload responsibilities and organizational procedures. When a Contracting Officer moves from one organization to another, the losing organization’s FP shall change the affected warrant record to Inactive and annotate any pertinent information in the notes. The gaining FP shall review the incoming Contracting Officer’s warrant record to ensure it is current, accurate, complete, and in good standing. Further instructions regarding electronically transferring a warrant to a new organization are located in the <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/PK-Central/AFCC/afmc_pk_mp_ig/Warrant/SitePages/Warrant-Home.aspx" target="_blank">AFCOWTT</a>. </p><p class="p List2">(2) Warrant reinstatement is applicable to an individual who previously held an AF warrant and whose warrant was subsequently terminated for reasons such as reassignment or resignation.

Current COs are not required to be tested, boarded, or reappointed as a result of the issuance of, or changes to, this MP; however, those with limited non- transferable or limited transferable warrants must meet the requirements of this MP to obtain a transferable and/or higher dollar value warrant. </p><p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(p) <u class="ph u">Warrants Issued Based on External Warrant Credentials</u>. A new AF 1102 with external, federal government CO experience may be issued an DAF warrant without meeting the requirements of this MP (COT and vetting process or warrant board) based on the discretion of the appointing official, provided they meet the qualification requirements at <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-201-federal-acquisition-regulations-system#201.603-2" target="_blank">DFARS 201.603-2</a>. The appointing official must conduct an assessment of the candidate’s qualifications and experience prior to the issuance of a DAF warrant. The appointing official shall document the rationale for appointment on the COWER (<a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/:w:/r/sites/AFCC/AQCP/KnowledgeCenter/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B23B580FA-FA4B-474E-8791-A687519C908F%7D&amp;file=external_warrant_credential_considerations.docx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true" target="_blank">See sample criteria</a>.) </p><p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(q) <u class="ph u">Warrant Reciprocity</u>. In December 2023, the Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force and the Army(Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) signed Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/AQCP/KnowledgeCenter/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FAFCC%2FAQCP%2FKnowledgeCenter%2FDocuments%2FAFFARS%5FLibrary%2FAFFARS%5F5301%2FDAF%20DA%20Warrant%20Reciprocity%20MOA%20revision%20%2801%20Dec%202023%29%2Epdf&amp;parent=%2Fsites%2FAFCC%2FAQCP%2FKnowledgeCenter%2FDocuments%2FAFFARS%5FLibrary%2FAFFARS%5F5301" target="_blank">Cross-Service Contingency Warranting Procedures</a>,between the two Departments. This MOA, which expires in December 2033, established a warrant reciprocity relationship during contingency operations as defined in l 0 U.S.C. § l01(a)(13), or in support of an emergency or major disaster as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 5122, or as otherwise directed by the Secretary of Defense in support of U.S. government-led operations (hereinafter, "contingency operations"). The MOA mandates recognition of cross-service warrants and qualifications for both military and civilian personnel and requires each services’ Head of the Contracting Activity (or delegated warranting authority) to recognize cross-service warrants and the qualifications and thresholds identified therein without additional testing, assessments, or issuinga new warrant. The intent of this MOA is to enable the lead Service for a contingency operation to avoid delays in providing expeditionary contracting support. </p><p class="p List1">(r) <u class="ph u">Reissuance of Warrant Certificates</u>. A request to reissue an existing warrant certificate for administrative purposes (e.g., damage to or deterioration of the original SF1402, name changes, etc.) is not a new appointment and may be submitted directly to the FP for processing to the appropriate appointing official; use of the COWER is not required.

Notwithstanding the requirements <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-207-acquisition-planning#DFARS_207.103" target="_blank">DFARS 207.103(e)</a>, acquisition plans may be written on a program basis when the requiring activity chooses to write a single plan for all known program actions or on an individual contract basis when there is only one contract, task or delivery order to be covered by the plan. An acquisition plan is not required for individual orders when the contract-level acquisition plan adequately covers all anticipated orders and the order is issued IAW the terms of the basic contract.</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(h) Contracting officers shall maintain decision support information in the contract file for acquisitions that do not require written acquisition plans as well as those that do. Where a written plan is not required, contract documentation such as memoranda for record, market research reports (i.e., <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/AQCP/KnowledgeCenter/SitePages/DAFFARS-Templates.aspx" target="_blank">Streamlined Market Acquisition Approach Document (SMRAA)</a>), and <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/AQCP/KnowledgeCenter/SitePages/DAFFARS-Templates.aspx" target="_blank">Streamlined Acquisition Strategy Summary (SASS)</a> may be used to record acquisition pre-award decisions and risk assessment information. The acquisition team shall ensure consistency among requirements, acquisition planning, market research, and solicitation documents and, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication of information between documents (e.g., by referencing content).</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(i) Unless otherwise designated by the acquisition approving authority, the planner for acquisitions is the program manager, or other official responsible for the program (i.e., requiring activity). </p>
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(j) The Senior Contracting Official (SCO) holds acquisition approving authority unless otherwise designated in <a class="xref" href="https://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/saf_aq/publication/afi63-101_20-101/afi63-101_20-101.pdf" target="_blank">DAFI 63-101/20-101 </a>, Integrated Life Cycle Management and <a class="xref" href="https://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/saf_aq/publication/dafi63-138/dafi63-138.pdf" target="_blank">DAFI 63-138</a>, Acquisition of Services.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(a)(1) Where a written acquisition plan is required, an Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP) shall be convened and chaired by the acquisition approving authority. ASP shall consist of members responsible for significant aspects of the acquisition, such as contracting, small business, fiscal, legal, and technical personnel. Unless waived by the acquisition approving authority, an ASP briefing shall be prepared by the planner and presented to the acquisition plan approving authority to allow discussion of the proposed strategy and promote an informed decision prior to approval of the plan. Written ASP briefing material may serve as the written acquisition plan provided documents address the acquisition plan content requirements of FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/7.105" target="_blank">7.105</a> and DFARS <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/207.105-contents-written-acquisition-plans." target="_blank">207.105</a>. Acquisition planning templates, including ASP briefing templates, can be found on https://www.afacpo.com/apm/core-documents/templates/or by using the AF Acquisition Process Model tool. </p>
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List2">(2) Regardless of dollar value, if a proposed change is for a new work outside the scope of the original acquisition plan, a revised acquisition plan based on the value of the new work shall be prepared. Whenever significant changes occur, the planner shall prepare a revised acquisition plan and a statement that summarizes the changes and obtain concurrence of the ASP and approval from the acquisition approving authority. </p>
         <p class="p Revised June 12, 2024 List1">(c) Before convening an ASP for DAF programs greater than $1B, the planner shall also coordinate with the DAF Intellectual Property (IP) Cadre (SAF/AQCC) in acquisition planning. Planners may coordinate with DAF IP Cadre on acquisition strategies of any dollar value where advice and assistance are needed to develop a robust IP strategy IAW <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#DAFFARS_5307_105">5307.105 Contents of Written Acquisition Plans</a>(b)(14)(iii).

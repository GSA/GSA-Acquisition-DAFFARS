If it is determined that a DD Form 254 at the IDV contract level will not cover varying needs of the classified effort in each delivery order, then a separate DD Form 254 should still be done for each delivery/task order as long as the separate DD Form 254 does not contain security requirements above that of the basic DD Form 254. </p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The purpose of the DAF ombudsman program is to foster
communication between Government and industry. The primary function
of the ombudsman is to hear concerns about specific issues in
acquisitions, to communicate these concerns to senior management
personnel responsible for oversight and to assist in the resolution
of the concerns. In accordance with 5301.9102(f) below, employees,
managers and customers may use the DAF component ombudsman when
seeking assistance in resolving procurement integrity issues.</p>

      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p List1">(a) MAJCOM/DRU/DAFRCO/ Commanders must appoint an
experienced senior official who is independent of the contracting
officer and program manager as the ombudsman at their organization.
For AFMC Centers, an ombudsman is required at each Center, instead
of at the MAJCOM. Centers may also have an ombudsman at each
Operating Location/Geographically Separated Unit. At FLDCOMs and
SDA, the HCA is responsible for the appointment instead of the
Commander.</p>
        <p class="p List1">(b) The ombudsman will have the authority to call
upon other resources of the activity to assist in resolving
acquisition issues or concerns (e.g., administrative support,
independent review teams).</p>
        <p class="p List1">(c) Contracting officers must identify the
ombudsman in the initial announcement of the acquisition as well as
in the draft and final RFP.</p>
        <p class="p List1">(d) The ombudsman must:</p>
        <p class="p List2">(1) Support acquisition personnel in the
resolution of issues or concerns raised by interested parties;</p>
        <p class="p List2">(2) Act in a manner that does not compromise the
interested party and, if requested, maintain anonymity of the
parties;</p>
        <p class="p List2">(3) Avoid any appearance of usurping normal
procurement authority (e.g., program manager, contracting officer,
and source selection authority);</p>
        <p class="p List2">(4) Ensure all affected or knowledgeable offices
and officials are consulted as part of any resolution process;</p>
        <p class="p List2">(5) Inform the Commander/Director, or PEO, as
required, of issues raised and actions taken;</p>
        <p class="p List2">(6) Review complaints relative to multiple-award
task order and delivery order contracts awarded under <a class="xref" href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&amp;edition=prelim&amp;req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title10-section3403&amp;f=treesort&amp;num=0&amp;saved=%7CKHRpdGxlOjEwIHNlY3Rpb246MzQwMSBlZGl0aW9uOnByZWxpbSkgT1IgKGdyYW51bGVpZDpVU0MtcHJlbGltLXRpdGxlMTAtc2VjdGlvbjM0MDEp%7CdHJlZXNvcnQ%3D%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim" target="_blank">10

to ensure that all contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to
be considered for task orders and delivery orders in excess of the
micro-purchase threshold, consistent with the procedures in the
contract;</p>
        <p class="p List2">(7) Consistent with security requirements, have
access to the appropriate offices and be allowed to collect all
facts relevant to the resolution of issues raised by interested
parties. Ombudsmen are granted access to proprietary information.
Source selection information must be obtained through the source
selection authority.</p>
        <p class="p List1">(e) The Ombudsman Program does not replace the
agency level protest, GAO bid protest or disputes processes.</p>
        <p class="p List1" id="DAFFARS_5301_9102__P783_20442">(f) The DAF ombudsman is the ADAS(C), who may
take action to assist in resolving issues, concerns, disagreements,
and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/DRU level, or for those having DAF wide implications.
The ADAS(C) is the DAF ombudsman for procurement integrity issues
(see <a class="xref" href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/policy/policyvault/USA004579-09-DPAP.pdf" target="_blank">OUSD(AT&amp;L)/DPAP

        <p class="p List1">(g) Government personnel may use the Ombudsman
Program as a way to express concerns about an acquisition.</p>

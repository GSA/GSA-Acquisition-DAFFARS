any clearance briefings or presentations, and that counsel’s
comments are included in the briefing or presentation.</p>
        <p class="p List1">(d) Only one clearance review may be performed
prior to the contract action being presented to the CAA. The CR is

clearance is not required when the negotiation team stays within
the pre-set negotiation range and the parameters approved at the
business clearance.</p>

        <p class="p List3">(i) The cognizant HCA is the business clearance
approval authority for all contract actions ≥$1B; and any
other contract action identified as special interest by the
cognizant HCA regardless of dollar amount. The HCA may delegate
clearance authority on a case-by-case basis. The procedures in <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/daffars/mp5301-federal-acquisition-regulations-system#DAFFARS_MP5301_9001" target="_blank">MP5301.9001(i)(1)(i)</a>
must be followed for clearance when SAF/AQC (DAS(C) or ADAS(C)) is
the clearance approval authority. SCOs retain contract clearance
approval authority.</p>
        <p class="p List3">(ii) The CAA is the approval authority for all
contract actions as delegated in TABLE 1. The Table 1 thresholds
represent the minimum delegation that must be made. SCOs may
increase the specified dollar thresholds at their discretion.</p>
        <p class="p List3">(iii) If a SCO reduces the thresholds or withholds
the clearance approval authority from the designees in TABLE 1, the
SCO must notify the <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/daffars/part-5302-definitions-words-and-terms" target="_blank">cognizant
HCA</a>. If the SCO reduces or withholds clearance approval
authority for more than six months, the SCO must brief the
cognizant HCA regarding the circumstances surrounding the decision.
regarding the circumstances surrounding the decision.</p>
        <p class="p List3">(iv) To facilitate planning for clearances that
require SAF/AQC approval, SCOs must use the <a class="xref" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/KnowledgeCenter/quarterly_updates/Forms/AllItems.aspx" target="_blank">Peer
Review and Clearance Forecasting Tool</a> to project upcoming
SAF/AQC clearances.</p>

and contract clearance are required for actions greater than or
equal to $5M.</p>
        <p class="p List3">(vi) For Operational contracting, business and
contract clearance are required for actions greater than or equal
to $3M.</p>
        <p class="p List3">(vii) SCOs are responsible for ensuring all
further delegations of clearance approval authorities are included

Delegation Letters/Thresholds</a> SharePoint page.</p>
        <p class="p List3">(viii) When a contracting official is the Source
Selection Authority (SSA) for a particular acquisition, the CAA
must be a level above the contracting official. If the SCO or their
deputy is the SSA, the CAA for that acquisition must be the
cognizant HCA.</p>
        <p class="p List2">(2) Clearance when the HCA is SSC/PK Director, SDA
Director, or SpRCO Director of Contracting.</p>
        <p class="p List3">(i) The SCO is the CAA for Non-Operational actions
valued at greater than or equal to $1B and for Operational actions
valued at greater than or equal to $10M. The HCA or SCO may
designate an action as Special Interest regardless of dollar value
and assign the CAA notwithstanding further delegations below.</p>
        <p class="p List3">(ii) The COCO is the CAA for Non-Operational
actions valued at less than $1B, and for Operational actions valued
at less than $10M.</p>
        <p class="p List3">(iii) The COCO may further delegate CAA within
their portfolio on either a class or individual basis without
restriction. The COCO may also set a threshold at which the
contracting officer is not required to seek clearance approval.</p>
        <p class="p List3">(iv) The COCO shall report clearance delegations
made on a class basis to the <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/daffars/part-5302-definitions-words-and-terms" target="_blank">cognizant
HCA Workflow</a>. SSC COCO class delegations can be found here.
Individual delegations must be documented in the contract file.</p>
        <p class="p List3">(v) The CAA shall, in all cases, be distinct from
the contracting officer responsible for executing the proposed
action.</p>
        <p class="p List3">(vi) When the HCA is SSC/PK Director, follow the

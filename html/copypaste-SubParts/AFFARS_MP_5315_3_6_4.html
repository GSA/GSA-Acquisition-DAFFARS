        Sessions.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">Source selection training must be presented to the
        entire SST, including the SSA, SSAC Chair and members, PM (where one is assigned), RO, and
        all advisors. Independent review of source selection training materials by SST members
        and/or attendance at “Train-the-Trainer” training is not sufficient to satisfy this training

               <strong class="ph b">Phase I</strong> (Acquisition Planning) training should be
          presented at the earliest stage of an acquisition and covers the acquisition process up to
          release of the RFP.

         <p class="p List2">6.4.2 Training Content and Process.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">The SAF/AQC FST develops and maintains source
        selection training modules to assist Source Selection Trainers. Trainers are encouraged to
        tailor the modules, as needed, to meet the unique elements of the instant acquisition.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">The <strong class="ph b">Ethics,
          Procurement Integrity, and Conflicts of Interest</strong> topic should be presented by the
        local legal advisor. Links to Ethics training material are included in both Phase I and
        Phase II source selection training materials. The use of locally-developed Ethics training
        by local legal advisors is encouraged. The length of the source selection training and the
        level of detail presented in either Phase I (Acquisition Planning) or Phase II (Source
        Selection Execution) depends on the complexity of the specific acquisition and the
        experience level of the SST.</p>

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern. </p>
			      <p class="p List1">(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

			      <p class="p List1">(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the ombudsman, [Insert names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and e-mail addresses of Center/MAJCOM/DRU/AFRCO/SMC ombudsman/ombudsmen].

         <p class="p Normal">The following mandatory procedure is provided
            for preparing 1279 Reports under DFARS 205.303 and Reports of Intent to Award multiyear
            contracts under <a class="xref" href="5317_170.html">AFFARS 5317.170</a> .</p>
         <p class="p List1"> (a)(i) The 1279 Report is used for Congressional
            notification and public announcement of contract awards that exceed the DoD threshold.
            Use the 1279 Report Format in (d), tailored where appropriate, when preparing Reports of
            Intent to Award IAW <a class="xref" href="5317_170.html">AFFARS 5317.170</a> . It is important
            to note that the Notice of Intent to Award IAW <a class="xref" href="5317_170.html">AFFARS
               5317.170</a> does not satisfy the requirement for a 1279 Report. </p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(ii) Alternate 1279 reporting for the
            announcement of source selection contract awards. If the awardee information cannot be
            provided three days in advance, the report does not need to identify the offeror that
            has been selected for award. Insert “Source Selection Information - Will Advise” for
            “Contractor Data” and either "$50 million or above" or "below $50 million" for “Face
            Value” and “Funding Data”. When using these procedures, provide the successful offeror,
            face value of the award, and funding data to <a class="xref" href="mailto:SAF.LLP.contract.ancmt@us.af.mil" target="_blank">
               <u class="ph u">SAF/LLP</u>
            </a>
            <span class="ph">
               <u class="ph u"></u>
            </span>no later than 1300 hours Eastern the day before the anticipated award date. If
            SAF/LLP is not notified by 1300 hours Eastern the day before the anticipated award date,
            announcement of the award may need to be delayed.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) After a 1279 Report has been submitted,
            report any changes in plans promptly to <a class="xref" href="mailto:SAF.LLP.contract.ancmt@us.af.mil" target="_blank">
               <u class="ph u">SAF/LLP</u>
            </a>.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) When immediate award is required and advance
            notification under paragraph (a) above was not accomplished, prepare the 1279 Report as
            usual and send it to <a class="xref" href="mailto:SAF.LLP.contract.ancmt@us.af.mil" target="_blank">
               <u class="ph u">SAF/LLP</u>
            </a>. Include the justification for immediate award. If the Congressional and public
            announcement cannot be made the same day as the award, the contracting officer must
            obtain the contractor’s agreement to withhold public announcement of the award until the
            award is posted on <a class="xref" href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts/" target="_blank">
               <u class="ph u">https://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts/</u>
            </a>. Include in the report a statement that this non-disclosure agreement has been
            made. The contracting officer will notify the contractor of the agreed upon date of
            public announcement. The award may then be made without the three-day coordination. </p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Format (do not include classified information
            in the report):</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Format the SUBJECT line of the email as
            follows: </p>
         <p class="p">FOUO: Release Date is DD MMM YY, Program Name, Contracting Activity,
            DD-LA-(AR) 1279 Report </p>

            in the 1279 Report. The italicized information below serves as a placeholder for
            “fill-ins”. Utilize the paragraph format provided to ensure the contract announcement is
            published. Do not use abbreviations and use full names of all contractors, including all
            subsidiary and division designations as appropriate. (Paragraphs 5 through 7 are to be

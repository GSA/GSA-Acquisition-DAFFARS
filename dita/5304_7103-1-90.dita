      <conbody>
        <p>Exchangeable repair contracts with provisions for modifications
require specific CLIN structures when there are multiple output
national stock numbers permitted. Whenever a family of part numbers
may be input under a specific repair and modification CLIN and the
output parts may have different NSNs, then each output NSN should
have a separate subCLIN. This will permit assigning a completion
date to specific reparable for delivery schedule tracking
purposes.</p>

For contracts where the content of the DD Form 254 contains classified information and the classified information cannot be segregated into classified attachments or addendums, use of NCCS is not required until such time that an automated solution is available on the appropriate classified information system. NCCS is available electronically at https://www.dcsa.mil/is/nccs. </p>

The coordinated and certified DD Form 254 shall be attached to the solicitation that is provided to the vendor(s). Distribution of the solicitation DD Form 254 per Air Force Industrial Security Policy is not required unless the vendor requires access to classified information during the pre-award phase of the contract. Solicitation means any request to submit offers or quotations to the Government. As such the solicitation stage includes but is not limited to: Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Information (RFI), Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA), Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), Grants, Cooperative Agreement, Other Transactions (OT) and other extraordinary actions.

In this case, a separate DD Form 254 will not be required for delivery, task orders, or equivalent pending all the security requirements are identical for each order against the IDV contract or agreement, at the discretion of the servicing Contracting Officer and will be documented in block 13. If the security requirements for the task, delivery, or purchase order for a contract or agreement result in additional security requirements from that of the basic DD Form 254, a revised basic DD Form 254 is required. The servicing Contracting Officer will determine how to document use of the basic DD Form 254 on all delivery, purchase, or task orders for all prime contracts or agreements, if applicable. If it is determined that a DD Form 254 at the IDV contract level will not cover varying needs of the classified effort in each delivery order, then a separate DD Form 254 should still be done for each delivery/task order as long as the separate DD Form 254 does not contain security requirements above that of the basic DD Form 254. </p>

If the awardee information cannot be provided three days in advance, the report does not need to identify the offeror that has been selected for award. Insert “Source Selection Information - Will Advise” for “Contractor Data” and either "$50 million or above" or "below $50 million" for “Face Value” and “Funding Data”. When using these procedures, provide the successful offeror, face value of the award, and funding data to <xref format="mailto"

Assistance may be solicited from other sources such as contracting officers, auditors, disbursing officers, and, if necessary, field visits to the contractor or institution. For nonprofit educational or research institutions, SAF/FMPA will determine if approved advance payments will be disbursed from an advance payment pool in accordance with DFARS 232.470. When approved, SAF/FMPA will forward the findings, determinations, and authorization for advance payments and/or the advance payment pool agreement to the contracting officer. The contracting officer must ensure all applicable advance payment clauses are incorporated into each contract. The clause at DFARS 252.232-7000, Advance Payment Pool, must be incorporated into each contract that is covered by the agreement.</p>

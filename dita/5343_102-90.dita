      <conbody>
      <p>Contracting officers shall document scope determination when modifying
        contracts (see the Scope Determination â€“ MFR template). New work
        requires competition unless one of the seven exceptions to competition
        found in FAR <xref
        scope="external"
        format="html"
        href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/6.302">6.302</xref> applies. When
        determining whether proposed modifications constitute new work the
        following should be considered- </p>
      <p
        outputclass="List1">(a) the extent of any changes in the type of work,
        performance period, and costs between the modification and the original
        contract; </p>
      <p
        outputclass="List1">(b) whether the original solicitation adequately
        advised offerors of the potential for the change or the change was the
        type that reasonably could have been anticipated; and </p>
      <p
        outputclass="List1">(c) whether the modification materially changes the
        field of competition for the requirement.</p>
      <p> For unilateral modifications authorized by clauses other than the
        Changes clause (e.g., Property clause, Options clause, Suspension of
        Work, etc. (see FAR <xref
        scope="external"
        format="html"
        href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/43.103">43.103</xref>(b)(3)), a
        scope determination is not required to be documented but is highly
        encouraged. </p>

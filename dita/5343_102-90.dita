      <conbody>

        <p>Contracting officers shall document scope determination when
modifying contracts. Proposed modifications generally constitute
new work when, the extent of any changes in the type of work,
performance period, and costs between the modification and the
original contract, as well as whether the original solicitation
adequately advised offerors of the potential for the change or
whether the change was the type that reasonably could have been
anticipated, and whether the modification materially changed the
field of competition for the requirement. New work requires
competition unless one of the seven exceptions to competition found
in <xref format="html" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-6#FAR_6_302" scope="external">FAR
6.302</xref> applies. See the “<xref format="html" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/AQCP/KnowledgeCenter/SitePages/DAFFARS-Templates.aspx" scope="external">Scope
Determination – MFR</xref>” template.</p>

The SecAF may grant a DNAD if compliant items, identified at DFARS 225.7002-1, of satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity, and in the required form, cannot be procured at U.S. market prices as and when needed. This approval authority is not delegable. This exception should not be read to require that the compliant material/item must be totally unavailable (i.e., cannot be obtained at any cost). There is some cost limit that should be recognizable by a contracting officer, and that a reasonable person would agree, makes the material/item effectively “unavailable.”</p>

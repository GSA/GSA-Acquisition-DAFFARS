        <p outputclass="List2">(1) ASP are integral to a deliberative process
that support the acquisition strategy approving authority in making
informed decisions in performing their acquisition execution
responsibilities. An ASP includes the Chair, panel members, and a
briefing supporting the proposed strategy.</p>

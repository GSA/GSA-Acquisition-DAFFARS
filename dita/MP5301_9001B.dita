            <i>(f)</i> If DPC Peer Review is required, the Business Clearance Session to brief the clearance approval official occurs either before or after the commencement of the DPC Peer Review Phase 1. The decision to hold Peer Reviews prior to Business Clearance approval will be made in coordination with SAF/AQC. Should Business Clearance be held prior to the Peer Review, Business Clearance is conditioned upon successful completion of the Peer Review. If DPC Peer Review is required, and the Business Clearance Session has been delegated to the SCO, follow the procedures above for notification and document submission to SAF/AQC.</p>

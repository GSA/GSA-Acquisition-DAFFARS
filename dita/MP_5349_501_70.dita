Because STCCs require special notification to Congress and entail a long approval process over which the Air Force has little control, the contracting officer should allow SAF/AQC sufficient time to process requests to use DFARS 252.249-7000, Special Termination Costs (i.e., not less than 90 days prior to contract award). The request must include the following:</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p " xtrf="CheckMapping">(i) A detailed breakdown of applicable cost categories in the clause at DFARS 252.249-7000<ph class="- topic/ph ">

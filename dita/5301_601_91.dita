         <p id="LukcHT" outputclass="List1">(c) For self-inspection of individual contract files reviewed after award, SCOs may use the <xref format="xlsx" href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/afcc/knowledge_center/templates/self_inspection_checklist.xlsx" scope="external">
               <u>Air Force Contracting Self-Inspection Checklist</u>
            </xref>; a comparable organizational checklist for post award reviews; or any combination thereof.</p>
         <p id="VaFZyK" outputclass="List1">(d) SCOs will ensure corrective actions are implemented as a result of any self-inspection. Contracting offices must have a documented program for self-inspection, to include a process for closing resolved findings in a timely manner, ensuring an effective level of review necessary to close a finding, and integrating findings and resolutions into unit training.</p>

         <p outputclass="List1" class="- topic/p ">(a) When an office (typically contracting,
            financial management, or legal) first learns of bankruptcy proceedings that may involve
            or affect the Air Force, that office must as a minimum provide notice to its supporting
            contracting, financial management, and legal offices. Once the contracting office and
            legal office are notified, they must work as a team to carry out the following
            responsibilities:</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1) The contracting office must furnish notice of
            the bankruptcy to any affected buying activities and to the Defense Finance and
            Accounting Service Office of General Counsel (DFAS-HGB) at the following address:</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">Office of General Counsel</p>

         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">The legal office must furnish notice to the
            Bankruptcy Branch of the Commercial Litigation Division of the Air Force Legal Services
            Agency (AFLOA/JAQ) at the following address:</p>
         <p outputclass="List3" class="- topic/p ">AFLOA/JAQ</p>

            contracts have been closed, terminated, or still have performance outstanding. Make
            notifications via the most expeditious method, but no later than three days after
            learning of the bankruptcy. Notify promptly, whether or not all required information is
            initially available, and even in cases where it appears the notifying office, itself,
            received late notice. Ensure the notification includes: </p>

            all known affiliates who have filed for bankruptcy; </p>

            was filed;</p>

         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(D) The case number assigned by the bankruptcy
            court.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2) Make an assessment of each of the debtor’s
            contracts and determine:</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(A) If the Air Force has a claim or potential
            claim against the debtor/contractor (e.g., based on unliquidated progress payments,
            nonconforming goods, estimated excess reprocurement costs, etc.), whether the contract
            is ongoing, closed, terminated, or otherwise in litigation. </p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) The current status and performance experience
            of each ongoing contract. The contractor may request the court’s permission to assume,
            sell, reject, or continue performing ongoing contracts. The contracting officer will
            need to coordinate with <xref href="mailto:AF.JACQ.ContractLaw.FieldSupportCntr.Mbx@us.af.mil"

            </xref> regarding all Government property in the possession of, or under the control of,
            the debtor/contractor. Failure to address such property in a timely manner may result in
            a loss to the Government if the property is lost, sold, or otherwise improperly disposed
            of by the debtor/contractor or the court appointed trustee. The contracting officer must
            suspend payments to the contractor/debtor while making the assessment of each contract.
            (The contracting officer must contact the appropriate DFAS payment office if necessary
            to halt a previous or recurring payment request.) </p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(A) On those contracts where the Air Force has no
            claim or potential claim against the contractor, the contracting officer may resume
            payments to the contractor only for amounts due post-petition. The “petition date” is
            the date the bankruptcy was filed with the court. Post-petition payments are only for
            debts based on work performed, or goods delivered, after the debtor/contractor filed for
            bankruptcy. If an invoice does not clearly indicate whether it is based upon
            pre-petition or post-petition performance, the contracting officer should contact the
            debtor’s/contractor’s billing office—prior to making any payments—to request invoicing
            that clearly identifies whether the requested payment is for pre-petition or
            post-petition work. It is the debtor’s/contractor’s responsibility to bifurcate invoices
            into pre-petition and post-petition billing where a particular job spans the bankruptcy
            filing date. The supporting attorney will need to assist the contracting officer in
            obtaining appropriate invoices if the billing is being conducted by the trustee or the
            debtor’s/contractor’s bankruptcy counsel. NOTE: contracting officers must work closely
            with DFAS to ensure post-petition payments reference only those post-petition invoices
            approved and forwarded by the contracting officer for payment. Be aware that DFAS’
            normal business practice may be to pay the oldest invoice on file first. Inadvertent
            payment of pre-petition invoices, versus the intended post-petition invoices, may result
            in the Government’s loss of security and, ultimately, reduce the potential for recovery
            of Government claims.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) The contracting officer should continue to
            withhold amounts due for pre-petition performance or deliveries while AFLOA/JAQ works
            with DFAS and the Department of Justice to determine if there are other Government
            claims which should be offset against those pre-petition amounts owed. Pre-petition
            debts are those amounts due for work performed or goods delivered before the bankruptcy
            petition was filed with the court. The contracting officer must not authorize
            pre-petition payments without prior coordination with and approval from <xref href="mailto:AF.JACQ.ContractLaw.FieldSupportCntr.Mbx@us.af.mil"

         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(C) These payment provisions augment, rather than
            supersede, otherwise applicable requirements regarding certification of payment
            requests.</p>
         <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(4) The contracting office and legal office must
            furnish information as follows:</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(A) Any information required above, but not
            available at the time of initial reporting, must be provided to the respective

            the contracting and legal offices.</p>
         <p outputclass="List4" class="- topic/p ">(B) Not later than 15 days after receiving notice

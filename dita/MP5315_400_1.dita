               outputclass="List2">(1) Breakout by Year. If the proposal includes more than one CLIN, the proposal shall include a breakout of CLIN prices by cost element by Contractor Fiscal Year (CFY). At the contracting officer’s direction, the breakout by year shall also be provided by: <i>(select applicable breakouts)</i> </p>
            <p>Government Fiscal Year (GFY)</p>
            <p>Calendar Year (CY)</p>
            <p>The proposal shall define the timeframe of the Contractor Fiscal Year (for example, January – December).</p>

               outputclass="List2">(3) When the proposal includes material costs, the proposal shall include a consolidated bill of materials (CBOM) at the total contract level in an electronic, sortable format (Excel spreadsheet or other format approved by the contracting officer). </p>
            <p
               outputclass="List3">i. When the amounts proposed in the CBOM include application of escalation, the proposal shall identify the base value, the escalation rate(s) used, and the escalation amount associated with each item escalated. </p>
            <p
               outputclass="List3">ii. When the proposed amount is based on historical data which has been adjusted (for example, for differences in quantity), the CBOM shall clearly identify the adjustments made to the historical data and the reason for each adjustment. </p>
            <p
               outputclass="List2">(4) All costs proposed on the basis of Cost Estimating Relationships (CER) shall be fully supported. The proposal shall identify the basis for the proposed rate, shall identify the base to which the rate is applied, and shall clearly demonstrate the calculation of proposed costs based on CERs. </p>
            <p
               outputclass="List2">(5) For any costs incurred prior to proposal submission, the proposal shall identify actual hours and cost incurred as well as hours/costs to complete and the time phasing associated with these hours/costs. This information/data shall be provided in a time-phased cost element summary format.</p>
            <p
               outputclass="List2">(6) Submission of Historical Actual Costs Incurred. <i>(Insert in RFPs for follow-on efforts as applicable. The contracting officer may identify specific contracts for which submission of actual cost data is required (for example, the last three lot buys of the same item), or may require that the contractor identify its most recent sales of the items to any customers, if the contractor’s sales base is broader than the current buying office. Language may be tailored to request insight into specific areas of cost (e.g., sustaining engineering hours). However, the contracting officer should take into consideration the extent to which the contractor’s existing business systems can support requests for granularity in reporting of actual costs incurred, as well as the potential time and cost involved in obtaining very detailed or low-level historical actuals.) </i> </p>
            <p
               outputclass="List1">(i) The contractor shall provide the following information for these prior acquisitions: <i>[contracting officer identifies the specific acquisitions for which actual cost data is required. Alternately, the contracting officer may require the contractor to identify prior and current contracts for the same items covered in this RFP.]</i> For these contracts, the contractor shall provide the following information: </p>

            <p
               outputclass="List1">(ii) The contractor shall also request that its top five major sole source subcontractors provide the information listed in the above paragraphs (i) a. through e. on prior contracts for items the prime is purchasing from the subcontractors for this effort. If a subcontractor’s information on prior actuals is not included in the prime’s proposal, the proposal should identify status and anticipated receipt date(s). If the subcontractor deems the information proprietary, the subcontractor may submit the information directly to the contracting officer. </p>
            <p
               outputclass="List2">(7) The proposal shall identify those actions where assist audits have been requested by the prime or sub-tier contractors and identify the request date and scheduled receipt date for those audits. The need for assist audits resulting from proprietary data rights assertions at any tier shall be identified to the contracting officer as soon as the offeror becomes aware of the need. Government performance of assist audits does not relieve the offeror of the responsibility to accomplish and provide its price/cost analysis of the subcontracts. </p>
            <p
               outputclass="List2">(8) If the offeror intends to request Performance-Based Payments (PBP), the offeror’s proposal shall include a monthly expenditure profile, proposed events and their projected completion dates, rationale on why the proposed event demonstrates significant progress towards the completion of the end item, proposed values for each event, completion criteria for each event, and an identification of each event as severable or cumulative. </p>
            <p
               outputclass="List2">(9) Commercial product and commercial service considerations: </p>
            <p

As a condition precedent to the use of a pre-contract cost agreement, the correct type of funds should be available upon issuance of the pre-contract cost agreement. While not legally necessary, prudent business acumen would dictate, that to the maximum extent possible, agreement on terms and conditions also be established prior to issuance of a pre-contract cost agreement. Contracting officers should consult with the designated clearance approval authority prior to agreement on pre-contract costs. The contracting officer should incorporate the pre-contract cost agreement into any resultant contract as an attachment within Section J.</p>

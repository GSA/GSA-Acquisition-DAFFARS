         <p class="p List2">(3) The Air Force Commercial Litigation Field Support
            Center (AF/JACQ) represents the Air Force on all protests.</p>
         <p class="p List2">Phone: (240) 612-6661, DSN 612-6661</p>

            </a>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The contracting officer must send any
            communication to the GAO through AF/JACQ with a courtesy copy to SAF/AQC and to the SCO focal
            point. Forward any inquiry received from an attorney representing a protestor or interested
            party to AF/JACQ.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) The <em class="ph i">focal point
         </em>is the designated SCO who receives communication from SAF/AQC concerning protests against
            Air Force solicitations or awards. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) The <em class="ph i">supporting</em>
            <em class="ph i"> legal office</em> is the office that provides legal support to
            the contracting activity that received the protest. An attorney from the supporting legal
            office will draft the memorandum of law, and otherwise support the defense of the protest.
            AFLOA/JAQ will provide protest guidance to the supporting legal office.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Actions </em>
            <em class="ph i">upon Receipt of Protest</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) SAF/AQC will notify the contracting activity when
            a protest has been filed with the GAO. The contracting activity must immediately notify its
            supporting legal office/local attorney who provides contract law advice.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The contracting officer must, within one business
            day of receiving the protest:</p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(i) Forward a copy of the protest to its supporting
            legal office/local attorney who provides contract law advice.</p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(ii) Provide a copy of the protest (or a redacted copy
            if the protest is designated as containing protected material) to the awardee, or if no award
            has been made, to all offerors who appear to have a reasonable prospect of receiving award. If
            no redacted copy of a protected protest was received, so advise AF/JACQ who will raise the
            issue with the protester. </p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(iii) Advise AF/JACQ and SAF/AQC as to all actions
            being taken regarding a stay of performance and any override of the stay to include:</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) A discussion of whether a stay of performance or
            award is required IAW 31 U.S.C. 3553.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) If a stay is required IAW FAR 33.104(b) or (c),
            whether an override will be sought to lift the stay. (See paragraph (h).)</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) If a stay is not required, discuss whether a
            suspension of performance or termination of the contract is in the best interest of the Air
            Force.</p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(iv) Send an email to <a class="xref" href="mailto:AF.JACQ.ContractLaw.FieldSupportCntr.Mbx@us.af.mil" target="_blank">
               <u class="ph u">AF/JACQ</u>
            </a> with the name, phone number, and e-mail address of the contracting officer and the
            local attorney.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The contracting officer is responsible for
            generating the contracting officer’s statement of facts. Within ten days after the Air Force
            receives the protest, provide the draft statement of facts and table of contents to its
            supporting legal office/local attorney who provides contract law advice. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The supporting legal office/local attorney is
            responsible for preparing the initial memorandum of law, which will include a legal analysis
            of each ground of protest.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) The contracting officer must e-mail drafts of the
            initial memorandum of law, statement of facts, and table of contents (including a listing of
            any requested documents deemed irrelevant) to AF/JACQ (copying the focal point) as soon as
            practicable, but not later than 15 days after the Air Force is notified of the protest (or
            seven days from the date the express option is invoked by the GAO).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Hearings</p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(i) If GAO calls for a hearing, the contracting
            activity must provide the requested witnesses and other support required by AF/JACQ. The
            contracting activity is responsible for funding witness travel and TDY costs.</p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(ii) At the request of the GAO through AF/JACQ or at
            the request of AF/JACQ, the contracting activity must obtain and fund court reporter services
            to transcribe the hearing. The cost of court reporter services is typically shared between the
            contracting activity, the protester, and the intervener. </p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Resolving</em>
            <em class="ph i"> the Protest</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) GAO Decision. If the protest goes to a written
            decision, the GAO will issue the decision within 100 days of the filing of the original
            protest. A protest decision involving protected information will be released to the parties
            under the protective order. A protected decision may be viewed within the government, but may
            not be released to, or discussed with, non-government personnel unless those personnel have
            been explicitly admitted to access of protected material under the protective order.
            Generally, those admitted to access under the protective order will be legal counsel for the
            protester and interveners. The GAO will issue a public redacted version of the decision at a
            later date. </p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(i) Denial or Dismissal. If the GAO denies or
            dismisses a protest, the protest is closed. The Air Force can proceed with all contractual
            actions upon notification of denial or dismissal.</p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(ii) Sustain. If the GAO sustains a protest, the GAO
            will also recommend corrective action and may recommend payment of reasonable protest costs,
            to include reasonable attorney fees. In some cases the GAO may also recommend payment of
            proposal preparation costs.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Corrective action should be accomplished pursuant
            to paragraph (g) below. A decision not to comply with a GAO recommendation for corrective
            action may only be made by SAF/AQC. Any recommendation not to comply with GAO’s corrective
            action recommendation must be coordinated with the focal point and forwarded through the SCO
            to SAF/AQC and AF/JACQ within 15 days of the date of the decision. </p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Potential costs may include attorney fees and
            in-house costs related to pursuit of the protest. Costs must be paid by the base or procuring
            activity. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Resolution
            of the protest may be possible through use of ADR. Outcome prediction is a form of ADR
            commonly used in bid protests in which the GAO advises the parties of its likely position if
            the protest were resolved in a written decision. Air Force policy is to follow the outcome
            prediction recommendations. Other nonbinding ADR procedures (including but not limited to
            mediation) are available and should be considered for use in appropriate cases. When
            considering the use of ADR proceedings other than outcome prediction to resolve a bid protest,
            and before initiating an ADR proceeding, the contracting officer and AF/JACQ must notify <a class="xref" href="mailto:SAF.GCR.Workflow@us.af.mil" target="_blank">
               <u class="ph u">SAF/GCR</u>
            </a> and <a class="xref" href="mailto:SAF.GCQ.Workflow@us.af.mil" target="_blank">
               <u class="ph u">SAF/GCQ</u>
            </a> and work with those offices to identify an ADR procedure appropriate to the individual
            case.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Withdrawal. The protester may withdraw the
            protest, either because of corrective action taken by the Air Force or for other reasons. Once
            the protester gives notice of withdrawal to the GAO and the GAO closes its file, the
            contracting activity can resume all contractual actions. </p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Corrective
            Action</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Corrective action may be taken by the Air Force at
            any time during the protest process or upon the recommendation of the GAO when a protest is
            sustained. Within five days of a decision to take corrective action (either voluntary or as
            recommended by the GAO), the contracting officer must provide a corrective action plan through
            their SCO to SAF/AQC and AF/JACQ. The contracting officer must notify SAF/AQC and AF/JACQ if
            there are any significant changes to the corrective action plan, if the corrective action will
            not be completed within 60 days, and when the corrective action is complete. The focal point
            should be copied on these messages.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Mandatory Stay of
            Award or Performance</em>

         <p class="p List3">• Ten days after date of contract award;</p>
         <p class="p List3">• If a debriefing is required, five days after the

         <p class="p List3">• Five days after the government delivers its written
            response to additional questions submitted by the unsuccessful offeror.</p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(ii) <span class="ph"> The Air Force can
            override a stay in appropriate circumstances when it can show a requisite level of harm
            resulting from a delay of contract award or performance. A challenge to the override

         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(ii) <span class="ph"> A stay of award may only

         </p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(iii) All requests must include facts that establish
            the urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United
            States. The request must explain, if there is an incumbent, why the incumbent’s contract
            cannot be extended. The request must explain what other options are available and why those
            options, if any, are not viable.</p>

            5333.104(c)(2)</a> for processing instructions.</p>
         <p class="p CheckMapping List3">(ii) A stay of performance may only be overridden by

         </p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The request to the HCA for an override must
            include the findings required by FAR 33.104(b) or (c).</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The HCA will make a decision with respect to
            authorizing award or continued performance within ten days of the protest notification by
            SAF/AQC. If circumstances change after suspension of contract performance, the contracting
            officer may initiate a request to continue performance.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) The HCA’s decision to override is not effective
            until a written finding is made and the agency files with GAO either a copy of any issued
            determination and finding, or a statement by the individual who approved the determination and
            finding that explains the statutory basis for the override, in accordance with FAR
            33.104(b)(2) or (c)(3). Notification should include the protester’s name and the B-number
            assigned to the protest. Copies of the signed notice and the finding must be sent to <a class="xref" href="mailto:SAF.AQ.SAF-AQC.Workflow@us.af.mil" target="_blank">
